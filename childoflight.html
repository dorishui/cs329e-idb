					<th> Description: </th>
					<td>Child of Light's gameplay is described as having attributes of a side-scroller with role-playing elements such as leveling up to increase stats over time.Battles with enemies use a system similar to the active-time battle system found in games like the Final Fantasy series and the Grandia series.The player can control up to two characters during battle, while the other characters don't level up the same way. Up to three enemies can appear during battle. If the player approaches an enemy from behind the battle becomes a "Surprise Strike", giving the player an advantage. If the enemy approaches the player from behind, it becomes an "Ambush", giving the enemy an advantage. The character Igniculus is used as an in-game mechanic during battle. The player can freely move Igniculus and shine his light on an enemy to slow it down or on an ally to heal them.</td>
