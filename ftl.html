					<th> Description: </th>
					<td>The player controls a spacecraft capable of traveling faster-than-light (FTL). It belongs to the Galactic Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with rebel forces, chiefly human in species. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction or capture by the pursuing rebels. The final sector ends with a battle against the Rebel Flagship, a multi-stage fight which results in victory or defeat for the Federation.</td>
