					<th> Description: </th>
					<td>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, with platform game elements. The player assumes control of Nathan Drake, who is physically adept and is able to jump, sprint, climb, swim, scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points, swing with a rope, use a grappling hook and perform other acrobatic actions. Drake can use various weapons to attack enemies. Stealth elements are incorporated into the game, allowing the player to sneak up to enemies and attack them without being noticed.[1] The melee combat system was reworked to avoid the presence of quick time events,[2] and Drake can control vehicles directly.</td>
